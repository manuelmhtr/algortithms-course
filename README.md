# Algorithms Specialization

My assignments for the Stanford [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms).

### 01 Karatsuba Multiplication

Multiplies two integers using the Karatsuba Multiplication algorithm.

```sh
$ python3 ./karatsuba.py <integer 1> <integer 2>
```

### 02 Inversions count

Given an arrays of integer, counts the number of inversions there are in the list. An inversion occurs when an integer is placed outside the ascending order in the list. For example the array `[1, 2, 3]` has not inversions but `[1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]` has 3: `(3, 2)`, `(5, 2)` and `(5, 4)`.

```sh
$ python3 ./inversions-count/solution.py
# It will use the file sample-input.txt as input
```
