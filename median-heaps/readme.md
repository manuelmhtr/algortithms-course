# Medians using heaps

The goal of this problem is to implement the "Median Maintenance" algorithm (covered in the Week 3 lecture on heap applications). The text file contains a list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order; you should treat this as a stream of numbers, arriving one by one. Letting x_i denote the i_th number of the file, the k_th median m_k is defined as the median of the numbers x_1, ..., x_k; (So, if k is odd, then m_k is ((k+1)/2)th smallest number among x_1, ..., x_k; if k is even, then m_k is the (k/2)th smallest number among x_1, ...,x_k.

In the box below you should type the sum of these 10000 medians, modulo 10000 (i.e., only the last 4 digits). That is, you should compute (m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + ... + m_10000) mod 10000.

OPTIONAL EXERCISE: Compare the performance achieved by heap-based and search-tree-based implementations of the algorithm.
